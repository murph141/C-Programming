In this assignment, we will compute several properties of an array of
integers.

PLEASE NOTE: 
(1) You should only modify the file answer01.c 
(2) You can modify this file however you want, including adding additional
functions. (This is true for all assignments.)  
(3) You must only submit the file answer01.c for marking
(4) Parts of the assignment have been written for you, but these parts do 
not appear in the file answer01.c. Please browse through these files 
(pa01.c and pa01.h).

This assignment includes many pieces of useful information and you
will learn these pieces in the coming weeks.  Do not worry if you do
not understand everything in the first week.  Focus on writing the
functions in answer01.c.  If you have taken the prerequisite CS 159,
you should have no problem filling the code for these functions.

If you need help, please visit the intructors' or the teaching
assistants' office hours.

================================ 
= Getting the Assignment Files =
================================

Assignments will be distributed to you via the version control system
"git". This very useful program will allow the teaching staff to make
modifications to assignments as problems arise, and then distribute
them to all of you. As students, you will have "read-only" access to
the assignment repository. The URL for the repository is:

https://github.com/yunghsianglu/ECE264Assignments.git

Use the "clone" command to get a copy of the files:

aturing ~/School > git clone <type-url-here>

Once you have a copy of the files, you can "cd" into the repository
and use the "pull" command to get the latest version of the assignment
files:

aturing ~/School > cd ECE264Assignments 
aturing ~/School/ECE264Assignments > git pull

====================== 
= Assignment Details = 
======================

In this assignment we shall: 
* add all elements in an array of integers 
* determine whether any element in the array is a negative number 
* determine whether the elements' values are always increasing

This program has the following files: 
(1) pa01.h      A header file 
(2) pa01.c      A C file that contains "main", the program entry point
(3) answer01.c  A C file (only edit and submit this file)
(4) Makefile    A file that "make" uses to build and test your solution

To use the makefile, you need to cd into the assignment directory and
type "make" in the Linux terminal. Type "make help" for a list of
options. For example:

aturing ~/School/ECE2644Assignments/PA01 > make help

After you finish this program, upload answer01.c to Blackboard and
submit it. Your program /must/, *must*, !!MUST!! compile against the 
original assignment files (pa01.c and pa01.h), otherwise you will get
zero. NO EXCEPTIONS.

========================= 
= Using Version Control =
=========================

For PA03, PA04, and PA05, you will need to show evidence that you are
using version control. You can use the version control tool of your
preferrence; however, we recommend that you learn git. The evidence
required is the log file of your commits.

This is not required for PA01; however, it is worth figuring this
out. It may be frustrating or awkward at times; however, version
control is an /essential/ tool for computer programming in groups, and
is also highly recommended when working on single person projects as
well. Spend the time now to understand what you are doing, and that
will /save/ time later.

Conceptually there are two repositories to deal with: the repository
where you do your work (you control everything), and the repository
that the staff use to distribute assignments to you. (URL given
above.) This second repository will hence-forth be called
"R-problem". The repository that you control will be referred to as
"R-answer". These *must* be in /separate/ directories in your account.

Do not modify anything in R-problem because it is read-only for
you. When you need to do a "git pull", git will want to delete all
your changes! IF YOU MODIFY R-problem, YOUR CODE WILL BE ERASED WHEN
YOU DO "git pull".

To set up R-answer, you will need to do some reading on the
internet. There are many useful tutorials, and a bit of jargon that
you must master. The internet contains everything you need to know
to pull this off. Learning how to problem solve using information on
the internet is an /essential/ skill for computer programing. Below is
the URL for the official git tutorial. It is a starting point for your
investigations:

http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial

Once you have done a "git pull" in R-problem, you will need to
immediately copy the problems (and modifications) to R-answer. Then,
write your programs in R-answer, and remember to commit and push
often. It is advised that you COMMIT AND PUSH AT LEAST ONCE PER
SESSION. (I never leave my computer for the day without committing
changes.)

In the rare cases when you are suspected of copying code, the commit
log can be used as definitive evidence that you are developing your
solutions step by step. However, if you commit only once before
submission, you will not be able to use your commit log as evidence.

ECE 264 requires that you submit source-control logs for only three
assignments (PA03-PA05). After these three assignments, you are
expected to continue using version control by yourself, even though it
is no longer a requirement.

IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF USING VERSION CONTROL in PA03-PA05,
YOUR SUBSEQUENTIAL ASSIGNMENTS WILL NOT BE GRADED AND YOU WILL
DEFINITELY RECEIVE F IN THIS COURSE.
